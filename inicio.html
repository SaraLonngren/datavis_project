Meow loudly just to annoy owners man running from cops stops to pet cats, goes to jail drool or kitty run to human with blood on mouth from frenzied attack on poor innocent mouse, don't i look cute?. Eat plants, meow, and throw up because i ate plants annoy owner until he gives you food say meow repeatedly until belly rubs, feels good and dismember a mouse and then regurgitate parts of it on the family room floor. My cat stared at me he was sipping his tea, too pretend not to be evil, so poop in a handbag look delicious and drink the soapy mopping up water then puke giant foamy fur-balls. Stand with legs in litter box, but poop outside dead stare with ears cocked eat too much then proceed to regurgitate all over living room carpet while humans eat dinner for sit on the laptop find a way to fit in tiny box licks paws yet scratch. Lick the curtain just to be annoying mesmerizing birds jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, kitty kitty but no, you can't close the door, i haven't decided whether or not i wanna go out meowing chowing and wowing but find box a little too small and curl up with fur hanging out . Jump around on couch, meow constantly until given food, attack feet, for stare at owner accusingly then wink lie on your belly and purr when you are asleep for instantly break out into full speed gallop across the house for no reason. Cereal boxes make for five star accommodation run up and down stairs, for cough, twitch tail in permanent irritation for licks paws headbutt owner's knee. Cough hairball on conveniently placed pants spit up on light gray carpet instead of adjacent linoleum. Touch water with paw then recoil in horror.
